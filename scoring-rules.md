# Zenquarium Scoring Rules

## Overview

Points are earned through good tank management and lost through neglect. The score is displayed on the HUD and can never drop below zero. A **health streak multiplier** amplifies all point earnings when the tank is well maintained.

---

## Health Streak Multiplier

When **all fish** maintain health above 80%, a streak timer begins. The longer the streak, the higher the multiplier applied to all positive score events.

| Duration | Multiplier | Badge Color |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| 0–29s    | ×1         | Dim         |
| 30–89s   | ×1.5       | Gold        |
| 90–179s  | ×2         | Orange      |
| 180s+    | ×3         | Red (pulse) |

- If **any fish** drops below 50% health, the multiplier resets to ×1.
- Tap the score on the HUD to see current multiplier details.

|-------|--------|-----------|----------|

## Score Costs

These actions spend score points (not penalties — they are purchases).

|--------|------|
| Feed   | 5    |
| Clean  | 10   |
| Buy Fish | 15 |

## Tips for High Scores

1. **Keep all fish healthy** to build the streak multiplier — ×3 triples all bonuses.
2. **Diversify your tank** — having all 4 species earns the Biodiversity bonus every 45 seconds.
3. **Clean proactively** — cleaning above 70% health earns the Clean Sweep bonus.
4. **Avoid tapping the glass** — it stresses the fish and costs points.
5. **Feed regularly** — starving fish incur a harsher penalty (−20) than regular deaths (−15).
6. **Aim for a full tank** — 5+ fish with high health earns the Perfect Tank bonus every 60 seconds.
7. **Leave creatures alone** — a peaceful departure earns +30, but provoking them costs −20 to −25 (though surviving the attack earns +40 to +50 if no fish die).
8. **Take calculated risks** — provoking a creature is a gamble: you lose points up front, but earn even more if all fish survive the attack.
