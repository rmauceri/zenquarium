# Zenquarium Scoring Rules

## Overview

Points are earned through good tank management and lost through neglect. The score is displayed on the HUD and can never drop below zero. A **health streak multiplier** amplifies all point earnings when the tank is well maintained.

## Health Streak Multiplier

When **all fish** maintain health above 80%, a streak timer begins. The longer the streak, the higher the multiplier applied to all positive score events.

| Duration | Multiplier | Badge Color |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| 0–29s    | ×1         | Dim         |
| 30–89s   | ×1.5       | Gold        |
| 90–179s  | ×2         | Orange      |
| 180s+    | ×3         | Red (pulse) |

- If **any fish** drops below 50% health, the multiplier resets to ×1.
- Tap the score on the HUD to see current multiplier details.

### Repeatable Bonuses

These bonuses can be earned repeatedly throughout a session.

| Event | Points | Condition | Cooldown |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Perfect Tank | +25 | All fish health >90%, 5+ fish in tank | Every 60 seconds |

| Baby Born | +10 | A baby fish is born | Each birth event |
| Clean Sweep | +20 | Clean the tank when health is already >70% | Each qualifying clean |

### Creature Interaction Bonuses

Easter egg creatures (jellyfish, octopus, squid) visit your tank periodically. **Creatures are dangerous** — they will eat fish on contact. Jellyfish drift passively and kill by accident. Octopus and squid actively hunt nearby fish, lunging toward prey. Tap a creature to chase it away (it flees for 2-3 seconds), but don't tap 3 times within 5 seconds or it will retaliate with stingers or ink. Creatures only begin attacking once fully on-screen, and have an 8-second cooldown between kills.

| Event | Points | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Creature Sighting | +15 | Each time a creature spawns in your tank |
| Creature Whisperer | +30 | A creature leaves your tank without eating any fish |
| Stinger Survivor | +50 | All fish survive a jellyfish stinger attack (awarded after stingers expire) |
| Ink Cloud Survivor | +40 | All fish survive an octopus/squid ink cloud (awarded after cloud fades) |

## Score Penalties

Penalties reduce the score but never below zero.

### Per-Event Penalties

| Event | Points | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Fish Death | −15 | A fish dies (non-starvation) |
| Fish Eaten | −15 | A fish is eaten by a predator fish or creature |
| Starvation | −20 | A fish dies with hunger below 10% |
| Overstressed | −5 | Excessive glass tapping (stress accumulator >10) |
| Provoked Stingers | −25 | You tapped a jellyfish 3 times, triggering its stingers |
| Provoked Ink | −20 | You tapped an octopus/squid 3 times, triggering ink + health damage |

### Repeatable Penalties

| Event | Points | Condition | Cooldown |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Neglected Tank | −10 | Tank health below 25% | Every 30 seconds |

---

## Score Costs

These actions spend score points (not penalties — they are purchases).

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Feed   | 5    |
| Clean  | 10   |
| Buy Fish | 15 |

## Tips for High Scores

1. **Keep all fish healthy** to build the streak multiplier — ×3 triples all bonuses.
2. **Diversify your tank** — having all 4 species earns the Biodiversity bonus every 45 seconds.
3. **Clean proactively** — cleaning above 70% health earns the Clean Sweep bonus.
4. **Avoid tapping the glass** — it stresses the fish and costs points.
5. **Feed regularly** — starving fish incur a harsher penalty (−20) than regular deaths (−15).
6. **Aim for a full tank** — 5+ fish with high health earns the Perfect Tank bonus every 60 seconds.
7. **Defend against creatures** — tap to chase them away before they eat your fish. A creature that leaves without eating earns +30. But don't tap 3 times or you'll provoke stingers/ink (−20 to −25), though surviving the attack earns +40 to +50.
8. **Watch for octopus and squid** — they actively hunt your fish, unlike passive jellyfish. Their eyes lock onto prey before lunging.
